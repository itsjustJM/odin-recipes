I am creating a basic HTML website that showcases the skills I have learned so far. The website is for some recipes that I have had laying around from my grandmother! This will be a great way to show her some love in the digital era. Kinda cheesy. With that, creating this website will allow me to use all of the HTML and GIT commands and skills I have gained thus far. Commiting GITs, inspect, pages, relative links, images and lists. Quite excited to begin this project!
